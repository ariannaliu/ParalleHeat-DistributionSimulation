# ParalleHeat-DistributionSimulation
Using MPI, Pthread, OpenMP, MPI+OpenMP, CUDA to implement parallel N-Body Simulation

PLEASE follow the instructions in the PDF file.

Description :
Figure 6.11 shows a room has four walls and a fireplace.  The temperature of the wall is 20ºC, and the temperature of the fireplace is 100ºC.  Write MPI, Pthread, CUDA and OpenMP programs using Jacobi iteration to compute the temperature inside the room and plot (preferably in color) temperature contours at 5ºC intervals using Xlib or other GUI systems on your computers in each iteration.
